Problem:

 

According to the user (or their browser) the current time apparently is 9:45..ish and we have no idea if they're talking 12 or 24 hour time and whether their clock is accurate enough to begin with.

Despite all of this, we'd really like to be able offer them a sensible list of *probable* timezone options (and not the 98 *possible*).

 

e.g.

You said it was 9:45 where you are. (It's around 9:43PM where I am.)

 

Do any of the following timezones sound about right?

 o Mid Atlantic

 o Brisbane

 o Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney

 o Guam, Port Moresby

 o Hobart 

 o Vladivostok
